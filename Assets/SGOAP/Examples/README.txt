To view an example, export the .unitypackage. Do note, if you've exported the Action Chaining example, when following along with the tutorial, you'll need to use a different namespace.
I highly suggest looking at Coroutine Example, Animation Example and then Action Chaining. 
Wood Cutter and Combat Example is now legacy. I don't reccomend following the patterns in it.

Examples:
	Animation Example: This demonstrate how to modularily trigger animation using SetAnimatorProperty and AudioClipActionHandler, for coders, you can extend this however needed.
	Coroutine Example: This is pivotal if you prefer to use Coroutines. They are much easier for sequences and that's what some actions are. This example demonstrate how to inherit from CoroutineAction and log
	Action Chain Example: The Action chaining example shows how you can chain from one action to another. It also introduces how to maintain your code base. This has a video demo for it.
